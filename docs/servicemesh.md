# Service Mesh
Service Mesh technologies can bring intelligent network behavior to platform so application developers can leverage that without building specific support in their code. Most typical areas covered are:
- Traffic split - ability to decide where to route traffic based on percentage, headers or other conditions to enable canary releases or A/B testing
- Traffic control - implementing patterns like retry, circuit breaker, rate limit or mutual TLS authentication and encryption
- Visibility - ability to capture traffic statics and logging
